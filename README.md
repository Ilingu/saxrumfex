# [SAXRUMFEX]: 3 state cellular automata study

## Origin

Saw [this video](https://youtu.be/TvZI6Xc0J1Y) on youtube, it blowed my mind so I wanted to do the same

At the same time I wanted to learn an ~low level~ graphic api and I choose wgpu for its modernity

## Purpose

1. Have fun
2. Learn the basic of graphic programming
3. Learn a graphic api, here wgpu
4. Enjoy the beauty of rust (as always)
